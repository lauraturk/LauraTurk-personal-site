      <p>
        I am a detailed, dedicated, life-long learner passionate about
        creating social good through my work. I came to programming by way of
        teaching digital literacy and 21st Century Skills in public libraries,
        and have honed my ability to lead, collaborate and communicate with
        people from all walks of life.
